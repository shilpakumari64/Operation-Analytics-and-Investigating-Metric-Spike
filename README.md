# Operation Analytics and Investigating Metric Spike

This repository contains a project focused on operation analytics and investigating metric spikes. As a Data Analyst Lead at a company similar to Microsoft, I was tasked with analyzing different datasets to derive insights and answer questions from various departments.

## Project Overview

The project is divided into two case studies:

**Case Study 1: Job Data Analysis**
In this case study, I analyzed a job_data table containing information about jobs, actors, events, language, time spent, organization, and date. I performed several tasks including calculating the number of jobs reviewed per hour per day for November 2020, calculating the 7-day rolling average of throughput, determining the percentage share of each language in the last 30 days, and identifying duplicate rows in the data.

**Case Study 2: Investigating Metric Spike**
The second case study involved working with three tables: users, events, and email_events. I tackled tasks related to user engagement, user growth, weekly retention, weekly engagement per device, and email engagement metrics.

## Technologies Used

- SQL: I utilized SQL, particularly MySQL, for querying and manipulating the datasets.


### How to Use the Project

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
   
2. Set up a MySQL database and import the dataset provided in the data.

3. Open the SQL scripts using a MySQL client.

4. Execute the scripts to perform the desired analyses and calculations.

## Results and Conclusions

The project generated valuable insights and answers to various operational questions. The analyses performed helped identify trends, patterns, and areas for improvement within the company's operations. The findings can be used to optimize workflows, enhance cross-functional collaboration, and predict the overall growth or decline of the company's performance.

Feel free to explore the project and adapt the SQL scripts to suit your specific needs. I hope you find this repository informative and helpful in your own data analysis journey.
